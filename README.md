# FeedBack_Collection_System

This project is a simple yet elegant **Feedback Collection Web App** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to submit feedback with a star rating, select a category, and provide comments.  
The app then visually displays the feedback, along with a live **dashboard** showing total feedback count and average rating.

Features

Star Rating System — Users can select a rating (1-5) with interactive highlighted stars.  
Feedback Form — Collects name, category, rating, and comments.  
Dashboard Summary — Displays total number of feedback submissions and average rating in real time.  
Live Feedback Display — All submitted feedback is listed with rating, category, and comments.  
Responsive Design — Works across desktop and mobile devices.  
Attractive UI — Gradient backgrounds, card-based layout, and smooth animations.  
Anonymous Option — If name is not entered, the feedback is displayed as from "Anonymous."


# Technologies Used

HTML5 — Structure and form fields.  
CSS3 — Styling with gradients, shadows, and animations.  
JavaScript  — Handles star selection, form validation, feedback storage, and dashboard updates.  


 How It Works

1. User fills in their feedback (name, category, comments, rating).  
2. JavaScript validates input (rating & comments required).  
3. Feedback is stored in memory and displayed in the feedback list.  
4. Dashboard statistics (total feedback count & average rating) update instantly.  
5. Stars reset after every submission for the next user.
